                    Chocolate is derived from the fruits of cacao trees and as its popularity grew, this led to the
                    development of cacao tree
                    plantations. Cocoa comes from cacao beans and is the highly processed form of cacao e.g., by
                    roasting beans at high
                    temperatures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Did you known that roughly 400 to 450 cocoa beans are needed to make just one
                    pound (450g) of chocolate?
                    Each cacao tree produces around 2500 beans on average so chocolate production is definitely no easy
                    work.

                        As of 2020, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Ecuador and Nigeria were the top exporters of cocoa beans.
                        Cote
                        d’Ivoire, located in
                        West Africa was leading by a big margin with over 3.6 billion USD worth of cocoa bean exports.
                        Cote
                        d’Ivoire is the
                        leading exporter worldwide producing over 2 billion kilograms of cocoa beans each year. Ghana is
                        the
                        second largest
                        cocoa producing country.

                        Cocoa content refers to the % of the chocolate that is made from cocoa beans. Milk chocolate
                        tends
                        to have around 10-50% cocoa whilst dark chocolate has 50-90% cocoa.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It appears that generally, chocolates with cocoa content around 60-80% hit the sweet spot and
                        consistently yield higher
                        ratings, regardless of the number of ingredients. Ratings tend to get lower when the cocoa
                        content
                        leaves this range.
                        Overall, it appears that the number of ingredients in the chocolate do not greatly impact
                        consumer
                        preferences.
